## üîç Overview

**Speed Typer** is a modern web application designed to test and improve your typing speed and accuracy. The app provides real-time feedback on your typing performance, including words per minute (WPM), characters per minute (CPM), and accuracy metrics, all wrapped in a clean and responsive UI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy (60s), Medium (30s), or Hard (15s) challenges
- **Real-time Statistics**: Monitor your WPM, CPM, mistakes, and time remaining as you type
- **Detailed Results**: Get comprehensive feedback on your performance after each test
- **Random Text Selection**: Practice with a variety of paragraphs to ensure diverse typing experiences
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded characters indicate correct/incorrect typing in real-time
- **Sound Effects**: Audible feedback for keystrokes, errors, and test completion
- **Motivational Quotes**: Receive encouraging messages based on your performance
- **Persistent Settings**: Your difficulty preference is saved between sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on all device sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file establishes a clean, semantic structure for the application with three main sections:

1. **Settings Screen**:

   - Difficulty selection buttons
   - Instructions panel
   - Start button to begin the test

2. **Game Area**:

   - Input field for typing (hidden but focused)
   - Text display area with the paragraph to type
   - Real-time statistics panel (time, mistakes, WPM, CPM)
   - Retry button

3. **Results Screen**:
   - Comprehensive stats display (speed, accuracy, character count, errors)
   - Motivational quote based on performance
   - Options to try again or start a new test

The HTML utilizes Font Awesome icons to enhance visual appeal and user experience throughout the interface.

### CSS Styling

The `style.css` file implements a modern, clean design with:

- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties for consistent color theming and easy modification
- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox and CSS Grid for optimal display across all device sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Distinct styling for correct, incorrect, and active characters
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Card-based Design**: Clean, shadow-based components for visual separation
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient selectors and minimal nesting for optimal rendering

The styling creates a distraction-free environment that allows users to focus on the typing challenge while providing clear visual cues about their performance.

### JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file powers the application logic with several key components:

- **Game State Management**: Tracking typing progress, timer, mistakes, and statistics
- **Dynamic Text Generation**: Random paragraph selection and character-by-character rendering
- **Real-time Validation**: Character-by-character comparison as the user types
- **Statistics Calculation**: WPM, CPM, and accuracy algorithms
- **Local Storage Integration**: Saving user preferences and performance history
- **Event Handling**: Keyboard input processing and UI interaction management
- **Audio Feedback**: Sound effects for typing, errors, and test completion
- **Adaptive Experience**: Different motivational quotes based on performance level

The code is organized into focused functions with clear responsibilities, making it maintainable and extensible.
